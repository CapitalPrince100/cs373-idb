Underpinning this post was a series of conclusions \r\nextrapolated from Apple patent filings that indicate the ID team has been \r\nworking (in Japan) on some modifications to ceramic slurry casting, as well \r\nas an omnibus patent attempting to lay claim to any electronic gadget with \r\na ceramic enclosure. To say that I disagreed with this conclusion would be \r\nan understatement (there might have been some snarky back-n-forth on \r\nTwitter), but it was difficult to draw a conclusion given the real lack of \r\ndata.\r\n\r\nIn the intrim however, we have been given a large data point from of \r\nApple's packaging materials from the new ceramic Watch Edition - a small, \r\nbeautifully printed booklet that details the case manufacturing process. \r\nBefore we go on though, let me posit something that does not get nearly \r\nenough attention in Apple circles:\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0Apple is a Hardware Company and Machined Aluminum is their Primary \r\nPlatform\r\n\r\nAt peak production, Apple is manufacturing roughly 1 million iPhones per \r\nday. More importantly, every single one of those phones is sculpted to 10 \r\nmicron tolerances, from a single block of aluminum, as is every Mac, iPad, \r\nWatch and many of the accessories. It is difficult to convey to folks \r\nwithout a manufacturing background how insane this is, but let me try.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nYour typical phone has a stamped metal frame that gets placed into a mold \r\nto have the plastic outside shell injected around it. Total cycle time per \r\nphone of perhaps 20 seconds, and it isn't like this makes a chintzy part - \r\nthe same process is used to make the frame of a Glock. To build a million \r\nphone enclosures a day, you would need a few hundred machines and could fit \r\nthe entire operation into a healthy sized Shenzhen industrial building. You \r\ncan, of course, add some glitz and finishing processes to gussie up your \r\nplastic phone a bit, but those additions don't add very much time.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAn iPhone however, starts as a block of aluminum and is faced, milled, \r\ndrilled, tapped, and de-burred in a bevy of machining operations, getting \r\npassed (mostly by hand, but increasingly by robot arm) through a series of \r\nmills, each set-up with precision fixtures that hold one side of the phone \r\nto face the spindle. Just the interior cavity of an iPhone requires 3-4 \r\nminutes of takt time while micro end mills carve out the tiny details and \r\nfeatures that the interior components will locate against and fasten to. \r\nJust that one operation requires 3000 CNC mills to meet the 1 million per \r\nday demand. Add more machines to do the other sides of the phone, plus the \r\ncrazy high-tech multi-axis lathes that make the buttons, plus production \r\nfor iPads,and iMacs, and MacBooks, and Watches, and many of the \r\naccessories.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nA murder of Fanuc Robodrills\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis high cycle time is why Apple is the world's largest owner of CNC \r\nmilling machines and swiss style lathes. Rumors are that the number is \r\naround 40,000 with about half dedicated to iPhone production. I've seen \r\npictures of one shop with acres of Fanuc Robodrills making iPhones, and \r\nthat was only one of about a dozen such facilities. Apple is such a huge \r\nbuyer of a particular kind of mill (BT30 spindle drill-tap centers) that \r\nFanuc, Brother and DMG Mori each have factories dedicated to building \r\nmachines exclusively for Apple.\r\n\r\nThis is not a position that happened overnight; it is a capability and \r\nscale that could only come about through iterative, strategic, long-term \r\nevolution. This started well over a decade ago with the MacBook Air's \r\nunibody and has been relentlessly improved, deep partnerships cultivated, \r\nand new CNC machining techniques created to achieve the position Apple is \r\nin today. In many ways, Apple is far more dedicated to aluminum machining \r\nthan the company ever was to the PowerPC and switching away will be far \r\nmore tricky.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nObjectified\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe simple fact of the matter is, Apple has scaled themselves into a \r\nposition where any major material change to the iPhone must follow one of \r\nthree paths:\r\n\r\nMachine a New Material\r\nSimilar to the switch from 6061 to \"7000 series\" aluminum, Apple could find \r\na new material that could be swapped into the current manufacturing \r\nfootprint in a straightforward fashion. 7000 series aluminums machines \r\nabout 20% slower than 6000 series, so they could absorb a somewhat \r\nsubstantial cycle time hit, but continue to leverage the decade of process \r\nknowledge, capital equipment and partnerships they have cultivated. In a \r\nway, we see this with the Watch being made from 4 different materials, with \r\n3 of them using very similar processes. Perhaps a new magnesium or titanium \r\nalloy? Machined carbon fiber (a trend in the high-end knife world... and I \r\nknow lots of Apple engineers and ID folks are knife nerds).\u00a0\r\n\r\nA New Material with a Short Cycle Time\r\nThis is basically the promise of Liquid Metal - essentially a very crazy \r\nstrong metalic that can be injection molded, but comes out of the mold with \r\nall the fine details and beautiful surfaces in one, fast shot. Apple has \r\nhad this partnership public for many years now with an exclusive license \r\nagreement with the Liquid Metal patent holders. They could be working with \r\nthem, while also working with injection molding equipment makers to build \r\nmodified/tuned machinery (::cough::). With this process, Apple would go \r\nfrom 20,000 CNC mills making iPhones, to a few hundred, or perhaps a \r\nthousand, highly modified/specialized/proprietary injection mold machines. \r\nDoing this would be a major undertaking and huge technical achievement, but \r\nit is entirely within the capabilities and resources of Apple.\r\n\r\nA New, High Cycle Time Process and Material\r\nThe final option, is for Apple to bring a new process online with cycle \r\ntimes similar to the few minutes of machine time required to make the \r\ncurrent iPhone. To do this, Apple would need to essentially flip the switch \r\non an investment of roughly the same size of the current, machining \r\nfootprint. Not only would this be a logistical nightmare, but finding a \r\ncompany to produce that much machinery without 3-4 years of lead time would \r\nbe almost impossible (as a reference Haas and DMG Mori are neck and neck as \r\nthe world's largest CNC machine manufacturers, and they each only make \r\nabout 15,000 a year).\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhile the sheer scale of that last option might only be fully \r\ncomprehensible to someone like Horace Dediu, the best argument I can make \r\nagainst it is the Hunt for Red October. In one of the movie's best scenes, \r\nthe US National Security Council is made aware of a new crisis in Russia \r\nwhen the satellite flyover of their major Atlantic port reveals heat blooms \r\nin the engineering compartments of every ship in the fleet. For Apple to \r\nbring a whole new long-cycle time process online for the next iPhone (now \r\n10 months from launch), they would need warehouses with thousands of \r\nmachines already in situ, with thousands more in production. Teams of \r\nanalysts would have been reporting on such a move for months already.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAll of this circles us back to that little booklet that shipped with the \r\nceramic Watch Edition. I think it is a safe bet to say that if Apple was \r\nabout to leverage a whole new process for the efficient manufacturing of \r\nprecision ceramics for next year's iPhone, this new Watch model would be a \r\ntest balloon for at least some of those techniques. Now, it is important to \r\nnote that Apple has always skillfully knife edged their marketing \r\ndiscussion about manufacturing by being both hyper honest in their \r\ndescriptions, while being quite vague about the nitty gritty details. So if \r\nwe can all agree their materials are honest, let me be very plain - there \r\nis nothing revolutionary or new about how Apple is making the ceramic \r\nEdition watch.\r\n\r\nThe process they describe is meticulously executed, and because of the \r\nnature of the design - wherein ceramics are mimicking the engineering \r\nlayout of far more easily produced materials - probably the most \r\nlaboriously produced ceramic watch on the market. In fact, if we scale the \r\nnumbers used in the booklet up to iPhone size devices and cycle times, \r\nApple would need 2 football field's worth of kiln space for each ceramic \r\niPhone to sinter for the requisite 36 hours. For the 2 hours of hard \r\nceramic machining to finish the case details, Apple would need to go from \r\n20,000 CNC machines, to 250,000. They would need another 200,000 employees \r\nto perform the 2 hours of hand polishing to \"bring out the strength and \r\nluster.\"\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nMore bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing \r\ntechnology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the \r\nprimary patent the original Quora article pins most of it's extrapolations \r\non - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for \r\nceramics. The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming \r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nIn short, not only does the ceramic Watch quash any hopes of a ceramic \r\niPhone, I think it actually indicates that Apple isn't chasing down \r\nceramics for iPhone production any time on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nUnless...\r\n\r\nA central pillar of Jony Ive's design philosophy is honesty of materials. \r\nIt is one of those flowery phrases that I think gets glossed over most of \r\nthe time, but we've seen Apple really evolve the entire aesthetic of the \r\nhardware lineup around it. This picture from iFixIt strips all the vague \r\ndesign banter from the phrase; the inside of an iPhone 7\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nifixit.com\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis is the part nearly every word of this piece has focused on; the inside \r\ncavity of the iPhone. It is a remarkable piece of engineering, made \r\nabsolutely extraordinary when you realize the precision it is manufactured \r\nto and that 1 million of these get made per day.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWhat makes this product honest is that it isn't bullshit when Apple says \r\nthe iPhone is \"made from 7000 series aluminum.\" For almost every other big \r\nbrand consumer products company, your \"aluminum\" phone would rally just be \r\nan applique, a veneer, a pretty cover on bog standard plastic guts. Yes, \r\nthat phone would work just fine (again, Glock), but it wouldn't be honest.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nWith an iPhone, the very heart of the device's design and function is this \r\nsingle component. Like a Formula 1 car, this is a monocoque that serves as \r\nboth the external shell and the internal structure. It isn't a case, or an \r\nenclosure - it is a chassis.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nIt is entirely possible that the next iPhone could be \"made from ceramic\" \r\nthe same way other companies have aped Apple with faux aluminum skins. A \r\nsmooth, simple, ceramic skin, perfectly finished, with advanced UV cure \r\nadhesives holding a hidden, pedestrian structure. Such a phone would \r\nprobably look fantastic, it would bring all the functional advantages of \r\nceramic's durability and luster. I'm absolutely positive it would sell in \r\nthe crazy, Numbers sheet busting figures we all expect from the 10th \r\nAnniversary model of the world's most successful product in history.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nAnd I wouldn't want it, not one little bit.", "author": null, "publishedAt": null}, {"title": "In Investing, It\u2019s When You Start and When You Finish (2011)", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/01/02/business/20110102-metrics-graphic.html", "urlToImage": null, "description": "Annualized returns for the S.& P. 500., for nearly 4,000 periods.", "author": null, "publishedAt": null}, {"title": "Why Red Means Red in Almost Every Language - Issue 26: Color - Nautilus", "url": "http://nautil.us/issue/26/color/why-red-means-red-in-almost-every-language", "urlToImage": "http://static.nautil.us/6754_c25e9a36b62f62f58f847fa83c70dc91.png", "description": "When Paul Kay, then an anthropology graduate student at Harvard University, arrived in Tahiti in 1959 to study island life, he expected&#8230;", "author": null, "publishedAt": "2015-07-30T03:00:00Z"}, {"title": "A Cheap, 555-Based Geiger Counter", "url": "http://hackaday.com/2016/10/16/a-cheap-555-based-geiger-counter/", "urlToImage": "https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gm600.png?w=600&amp;h=600", "description": "Every mad scientist's lair needs a Geiger counter.
