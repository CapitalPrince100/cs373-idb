One of the first things I saw that looked promising was the chrome.webRequest API.\n\n\n\n From the docs: \u201cUse the chrome.webRequest API to observe and analyze traffic and to intercept, block, or modify requests in-flight.\u201d\n\n\n\n That seemed to be exactly what I needed.\n\n\n\n After experimenting with the Chrome webRequest API, I quickly realized there was a big problem. It didn\u2019t allow me to analyze any WebSocket traffic, something I really wanted to support.\n\n\n\n As I was searching the web trying to see if I was misreading the documentation or was looking in the wrong spot, I found a relevant bug report from 2012: \u201cchrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest doesn\u2019t intercept WebSocket requests.\u201d\nIn the bug report, users were complaining that without the ability to block WebSockets, websites could get around ad blockers fairly easily. If WebSocket data was not visible to Chrome extensions via the webRequest API, they could not be blocked without some heavy duty hacks.\n\n\n\n Initially, the risks to ad blockers seemed theoretical; the examples of sites that were employing this technique were very obscure. Then in August 2016, an employee of the company that owns Pornhub.com (MindGeek) started arguing against adding the WebSocket blocking capabilities to the Chrome API. Pornhub is the 63rd most visited site on the Internet according to Alexa. I checked out a few of MindGeek\u2019s sites and sure enough, I could see ads coming through even though I had Adblock Plus on. The ads on Pornhub are marked \u2018By Traffic Junky,\u2019 which is an ad network owned by MindGeek.\n\n\n\n In the screenshot below, you can see a banner at the top of the page announcing that the site is aware that the user is using an Ad Blocker, with an invitation to subscribe to a premium ads free version of the site. On the right side of the page you can see an advertisement.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nHow They Do It\n\n\n\n When you visit Pornhub.com, it tries to detect if you have an ad blocker. If it detects one, it opens a  WebSocket connection that acts as a backup mechanism for delivering ads.\n\n\n\n Watching the BugReplay browser recording, you can see a number of network requests triggered that are blocked by AdBlock: They are marked Failed in the network traffic, and if you click one to inspect the detail pane you can see the failed reason is net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT. That is the error reported by Chrome when an asset is blocked from loading.\n\n\n\n You can find the WebSocket frames individually in the network panel or just look at the WebSocket create request which has links to all the individual frames. The name of the domain where the WebSocket connects is \u201cws://ws.adspayformy.site.\u201d A decent joke aimed at ad blockers :)\n\n\n\n When the WebSocket loads, the browser sends a frame with a JSON encoded payload for each of the spots it has available for ads.\nChecking out one of the WebSocket frames, you can see in the frame data the advertisement data is sent back with:\n\n\n\n \n The zone_id 13, for where the JavaScript should place the ad.\n\n\n The media_type image, so the page knows what kind of element to create (most of the ads are videos, I picked an image for this post because it was relatively tame).\n\n\n The Image itself, transmitted base64 encoded so it can be reconstructed using the data uri scheme\n\n\n An \u201cimg_type\u201d (\u201cimage/jpeg\u201d) to pass to the data uri.\n\n\n\n Ad Blockers primarily work using the webRequest API, so constructing the ad by transmitting the data over the WebSocket as base64 is a pretty clever way of dodging the blocker.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s next\n\n\n\n On October 25th, 2016, there was some new activity on the Chromium ticket. A contributor wrote a patch adding the ability to block WebSockets using the webRequest api. If it\u2019s accepted, it will eventually wind up in Chrome stable.\n\n\n\n When or if that rolls out, the ad blocker extension writers can choose to remove the hacks for users of the latest Chrome, leaving content providers like Pornhub to figure out their next move in the ad blocking war.\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\n\n\n Since I started looking into this, AdBlock Plus and uBlock Origin have shipped workarounds to block this technique. AdBlock and others still do not.\n\n\n\n For AdBlock Plus, \u201cThe wrapper performs a dummy web request before WebSocket messages are sent/received. The extension recognizes these dummy web requests as representing a WebSocket message. It intercepts and blocks them if the corresponding WebSocket message should be blocked. The WebSocket wrapper then allows / blocks the WebSocket message based on whether the dummy web request was blocked or not.\u201d via\n\n\n\n For uBlock Origin, they shipped a workaround that has the \u201cability to foil WebSocket using a CSP directive.\u201d", "source_name": "Hacker News", "external_article_link": "http://blog.bugreplay.com/post/152579164219/pornhubdodgesadblockersusingwebsockets", "id_num": "232", "category": "Technology", "region": "United States", "title": "Pornhub Bypasses Ad Blockers with WebSockets", "external_source_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}, {"image_link": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/screen-shot-2016-10-28-at-21-14-32.png?w=764&amp;h=400&amp;crop=1", "pubDate": "2016-11-02", "description": "LinkedIn -- the professionally-oriented social networking platform\u00a0that's being acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 billion -- has made a play to build\u00a0what it..", "source_name": "Hacker News", "external_article_link": "http://social.techcrunch.com/2016/11/02/linkedin-plots-a-place-on-the-economic-graph-launches-salary-to-chart-what-we-earn/", "id_num": "233", "category": "Technology", "region": "United States", "title": "LinkedIn plots a place on the economic graph, launches Salary to chart what we\u00a0earn", "external_source_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}, {"image_link": "http://assets.tumblr.com/images/og/text_200.png", "pubDate": "2016-11-02", "description": "We\u2019ve been getting a ton of traffic at elementary.io and hearing a lot of chatter from Apple users after the underwhelming MacBook Pro event last week\u2014mainly that Apple has abandoned the \u201cPro\u201d market...", "source_name": "Hacker News", "external_article_link": "http://blog.elementary.io/post/152626170946/switching-from-macos-the-basics", "id_num": "234", "category": "Technology", "region": "United States", "title": "Switching from macOS: The Basics", "external_source_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}, {"image_link": null, "pubDate": "0000-00-00", "description": "Nano How-To explaining how to setup a root file system with only emacs.", "source_name": "Hacker News", "external_article_link": "http://www.informatimago.com/linux/emacs-on-user-mode-linux.html", "id_num": "235", "category": "Technology", "region": "United States", "title": "Emacs standing alone on a Linux Kernel", "external_source_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}, {"image_link": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-QJ789_micros_G_20161021092721.jpg", "pubDate": "2016-11-01", "description": "The hackers believed responsible for breaking into computers at the Democratic National Committee have exploited previously undisclosed flaws in Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system and Adobe\u2019s Flash software.", "source_name": "Hacker News", "external_article_link": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-says-russian-hackers-exploited-flaw-in-windows-1478039377", "id_num": "236", "category": "Technology", "region": "United States", "title": "Microsoft Says Russian Hackers Exploited Flaw in Windows", "external_source_link": "https://news.ycombinator.com"}, {"image_link": null, "pubDate": "0000-00-00", "description": "The latest Signal release for Android includes support for GIF search and browsing.
